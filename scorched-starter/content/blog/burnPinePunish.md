# I burn, I pine, I punish  
*5 Reasons Scorched Studio brings the heat*  
*By Emily Hawkala*

If Mr. William Shakespeare had a wood-burning studio in his day, the *Taming of the Shrew* may have never come to be, but at least his student apartment would have an extremely stylish coaster set.

We can’t confirm that spending time at Scorched will improve your romantic poetry, but it might improve your chances. Here’s five reasons why:

1. **Built for date night.** This venue is great for a planned-ahead romantic night. Enjoy one another’s company, then take home art that will last longer than your most recent situationship.

2. **Spontaneous friendly.** Not the planning type? Walk-ins are perfect for a last-minute-make-it-happen date, while still feeling intentional and worthwhile.

3. **Perfect get-to-know-you activity.** There’s plenty of time to talk, and your impressive (or less than) art skills will be a natural conversation topic. (And if you’re nervous about your abilities, our traceable designs will keep your confidence burning at an all-time high.)

4. **Add a drink.** If you’re feeling particularly chivalrous, buy your date a drink! Our fridge is full and waiting. An original activity and a good drink to sip on? Say hello to your second date.

5. **We set you up, you take the lead.** We’re intentional with getting you ready to create—then we give you space. (Talk about the perfect wingman.)

So if you’re looking for “a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes,” put down *Romeo and Juliet*, and pick up a heat pen. We’ll see you on date night!
